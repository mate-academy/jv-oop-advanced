## Common mistakes (jv-oop-advanced)

#### Don't begin class or method implementation with empty line.  
Remove all redundant empty lines, be careful :)

#### Don't use abstract classes to set behaviour for classes
Abstract classes and interfaces have different use cases. Try to figure out when to use 
both in this task by yourself. If you're blocked [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/479168) may give you a hint.

#### Don't use verbs for class/interface names
* Bad example:
```
public interface CalculateArea {
}
```
* Improved example:
```
public interface AreaCalculator {
}
```

#### Don't put all behaviour into a single interface if the methods are conceptually different from each other.
All our classes and interfaces should have a single purpose - `draw()` and `getArea()` methods are not conceptually close to each other.

#### You can pass random values to the constructor of a figure instead of generating them inside figure classes.
Let's generate random values in `FigureSupplier`.

#### Think about which variables should be local in the method and which should be class-level
* Bad example:
```
public class AccauntService {
    public int calculateTax(int income) {
        TaxService taxService = new TaxService();
        int tax = taxService.getTax();
        return income * tax / 100;
    }
}
```
* Improved example:
```
public class AccauntService {
    private TaxService taxService = new TaxService();

    public int calculateTax(int income) {        
        int tax = taxService.getTax();
        return income * tax / 100;
    }
}
```

#### All magic numbers in your code should be constants.
Please see [this article](https://mate-academy.github.io/style-guides/java/java.html#s5.2.4-constant-names) to learn about constant fields and their naming requirements.
* Bad example:
```
public class FigureSupplier {
    private Random random = new Random();

    public Figure getRandomFigure() {
        int `figureNumber` = random.nextInt(5);
        // generate a specific figure based on the `figureNumber` value
    }
}
```
* Improved example:
```
public class FigureSupplier {
    public static final int FIGURE_COUNT = 5;
    private Random random = new Random();

    public Figure getRandomFigure() {
        int figureNumber = random.nextInt(FIGURE_COUNT);
        // generate a specific figure based on the `figureNumber` value
    }
}
```

#### Creating a figure, don't pass expressions in constructor. 
Create separate variables and pass them for better code readability.
* Bad example:
```
Square square = new Square(random.nextInt(10) + 1);
```

#### Don't use static methods in your solution
Static methods are in general a bad practice. Let's better create an instance of a class which method you want to call.

#### Don't extend your `Main/Application` class from `FigureSupplier` or `ColorSupplier`.
To be able to call non-static method, we just need to create an instance of the class: 
```
FigureSupplier figureSupplier = new FigureSupplier();
Figure randomFigure = figureSupplier.getRandomFigure();
```

#### You should create several random Figures, so you will use a loop. Please don't create a `new FigureSupplier()` inside the loop.
Let's do it only once - before the loop starts.

#### Don't return `null` from a method.
Returning `null` from a method is a bad practice. If you use switch-case in your solution, you may just put the last possible option in the `default` case.

#### Use only eng in messages/code:
Try not to use ukr/ru messages in `toString()` or `System.out.println()` statements.
We want to make our code universal and consistent.

#### Use name() for getting String representation of enum constants

Don't use `toString()` or `String.valueOf()`(it will call `toString()` under the hood) for getting `String` representation of enum constants. 
`toString()` is common for all enum constants. If you override this method like below:
````
 @Override
 public String() toString() {
    return "default";
 }
````
then for every constant `toString()` will be returning `default`, that's not ok. So it's better to use standard method of enum `name()` 
that will be returning always `String` representation of concrete enum constant. 

#### Write informative messages when you commit code or open a PR.
Bad example of commit/PR message: `done`/`fixed`/`commit`/`solution`/`added homework`/`my solution` and other one-word, abstract or random messages.
